Custom floating filter components are controlled components, which receive a filter model as part of the props, and pass model updates back to the grid via the `onModelChange` callback. A filter model of `null` means that no filter is applied (the filter displays as inactive). Note that the filter is applied immediately when `onModelChange` is called.

```jsx
export default ({ model, onModelChange }) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <input
                type="text"
                value={model || ''}
                onChange={({ target: { value }}) => onModelChange(value === '' ? null : value)}
            />
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Custom Floating Filter Parameters

### Floating Filter Props

The following props are passed to the custom floating filter components (`CustomFloatingFilterDisplayProps` interface). If custom props are provided via the `colDef.floatingFilterParams` property, these will be additionally added to the props object, overriding items of the same name if a name clash exists.

{% interfaceDocumentation interfaceName="CustomFloatingFilterDisplayProps" config={ "description": "" } /%}

### Floating Filter Callbacks

The following callbacks can be passed to the `useGridFloatingFilter` hook (`CustomFloatingFilterCallbacks` interface). All the callbacks are optional, and the hook only needs to be used if callbacks are provided.
