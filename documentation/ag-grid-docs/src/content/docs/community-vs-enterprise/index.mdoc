## Test AG Grid Enterprise Features

You can test AG Grid Enterprise features locally without a licence key, just install the `ag-grid-enterprise` package and import the required modules - you do not need to provide a licence key. When you do not have a licence key installed then AG Grid Enterprise will display a watermark and an error message in the console.

## Request an Enterprise Bundle Trial Licence

If you would like to trial AG Grid Enterprise in your environment, please request a free trial license key. The trial license key will remove the watermark & console error message, and provide access to both AG Grid and AG Charts Enterprise.

## Choosing the Right Version

**AG Grid Community** is an excellent choice if you need a robust, feature-rich data grid without the need for advanced enterprise features. It is ideal for developers and organisations looking for a free, open-source solution.

**AG Grid Enterprise** is the preferred option for companies that need advanced functionality, dedicated support, and a flexible licencing model. It is suited for complex applications that demand high performance, extensive customization, and large-scale data handling.

**Enterprise Bundle** is the best choice for organisations that require both AG Grid Enterprise and AG Charts Enterprise, or those who have advanced use-cases for Integrated Charting.

## Support

AG Grid Community relies on community-driven support through GitHub and public forums.

AG Grid Enterprise provides dedicated support via [Zendesk](https://ag-grid.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) with guaranteed response times, bug fixes, and direct access to the AG Grid developers, who handle all support tickets. Support is also available during your free trial period.

Both AG Grid Community and Enterprise are open source, however, **AG Grid Community is available under the MIT licence** and **AG Grid Enterprise requires a commercial, EULA licence**.
